# SRS-FISH

This repository is adapted from the codebase used to produce the results in the paper "SRS-FISH: A high-throughput platform linking microbiome
metabolism to identity at the single-cell level".

## Requirements
The code in this repo can be implemented with the following software
* CellProfiler 4.2.1
* Matlab 2021a

## Files
This repo should contain the following files:
* CD_ratio_V9_FISH masked Bac Ratio.cpproj - single cell statistical analysis on FISH-masked-SRS data
* CD_ratio_V10_FISH_masked_gut_Image_save.cpproj - FISH masked SRS image processing for visualization
* CDratio_BoxPlot_multiCSV_v2.m - statistical check (box plot) on single cell SRS results 
* tif_txt_intensity_V8_FISHmasked.m - Bacteria countour and SRS intensity ratio plot for tif image or CellProfiler generated cell masks
